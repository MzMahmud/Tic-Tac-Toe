Tic-tac-toe
-----------
Introduction
------------
Even though may be there is no one single person in the word who have never played this game, I am pasting the wikipedia defination of this term.
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

My Goal
-------

Actually I am trying to learn `pygame` module of `python`. That is why I am gradually building the most basic game with it.

Progress
---------
- Currently my Tic-tac-toe game is played on commandline with the numberpad as the 3x3 input!
- I have implemented the `MiniMax` algorithm as the AI.
- Implemented the game in `pygame` with very basic graphics design!

Usage
-----
Install `pygame`

>`pip install pygame`

Then just run the `run.py` file

>`python run.py`
